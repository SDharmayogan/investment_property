This three/four bedroom mid terrace Edwardian family home forms part of the ever popular Lake House Estate.
This incredible property, which does require modernisation throughout, has plenty of character and many of the original period features. This really does have the potential to be your dream home.
As you enter the house you are welcomed by a spacious and airy reception room with a bay window, there is a further reception room which leads to a sun room suitable as a study and a large fitted kitchen with access to the garden.
To the first floor there are two very generous double bedrooms and a charming single bedroom. The loft is currently being used as a bedroom and is complete with Velux windows.
The property also benefits from a large rear garden. There is a spacious double garage to the rear which has been converted into an entertainment room with a bar.
