This property is bursting with potential and offers the new buyer a fantastic opportunity to create a stunning home with superb views over open fields to the rear. Nestled away in a highly desirable location in central Wanstead, this home is close to the popular Nightingale Primary School and just 0.5 miles from Wanstead High Street with its array of popular shops, bars, restaurants and two Central Line Stations. The property is in need of modernisation but retains a lot of original features, offering spacious accommodation throughout. The ground floor is comprised of a large lounge with a beautiful fireplace and large bay window, dining room with views over the garden, conservatory and a generous kitchen/breakfast room. The upstairs offers three bedrooms, separate bathroom to toilet and stairs leading up to a loft room, which could be used as an office, play room or unofficial bedroom. There is potential to convert the loft to create a good sized master bedroom and en-suite if desired (STPC). The rear garden is an excellent size with views over open fields, creating the sense of space and tranquillity; a rare find in London. The property is offered for sale chain free - ideal for anyone looking a quick, stress-free move!
