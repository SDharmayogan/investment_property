From the moment you walk through the double front doors into this imposing property it is clear that here is a house just waiting to be returned to its former glory. With a wealth of original, period features it offers space, grace and the prospect of being a lovely family home again. There are beautiful picture rails, cornices and ceiling roses in abundance, and original wooden floorboards are retained in every room. Two main reception rooms hint of grandeur with high ceilings and magnificent tiled fireplaces, whilst the dining room has the original walk-in pantry. Upstairs the master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and dressing room, and a large bay window with window seat. Three other double bedrooms have period cast iron fireplaces with tiled hearths.  From the landing with its light well the spacious loft offers potential for further development (subject to planning consent). French doors lead from the sitting room into a large, well-established garden with mature trees and shrubs. The property sits on a quiet road just minutes away from the green itself, with a short walk down to Woodford Central Line station for direct access into the City and West End. On the High Road there is a choice of restaurants, cafes, convenience stores and a post office. The Broadway has two supermarkets, a library, banks and several bars and cafes. Local schools are highly regarded, with both Woodford County High girls' grammar school and St Aubyn's school within easy walking distance.
