On offer is a detached four bedroom house on the highly desirable Carbery Avenue. To the ground floor are two well-proportioned reception rooms and kitchen, with conservatory to the rear, whilst on the first floor are four double bedrooms, with family bathroom and separate loo. The house also benefits from original features, off street parking, garage and well sized garden. There is also huge potential to extend to the rear, and into the large loft (STPP). With modernization, this could be one of the road's finest family homes. 
Carbery Avenue is ideally positioned, being equidistant to both Acton Town Station (0.5m) and Ealing Common Station (0.5m) whilst also being close to Gunnersbury Park. This is the perfect opportunity for any family.
