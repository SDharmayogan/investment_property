Designer, contemporary living in the heart of Ealing Common, a short walk from the station. The five bedroom semi-detached home has been extensively developed, refurbished and remodelled and there is an emphasis on creating a large, free-flowing kitchen, open plan reception to the rear leading to the garden of some 100'. 
The home with tudor style front elevation measures over 2000 sq ft and is set on a locally well renowned road given its tree-lined nature, its width and the deep frontage afforded to many of its homes.
The home has been developed to an exceptional standard. With an emphasis on highly quality fixtures and fittings the home creates a large lateral open-plan kitchen reception to the rear. A particular feature within this area of the home is the floor to ceiling tri-fold doors, extending across the width of rear reception, providing seamless access to the paved terrace at the onset of the large rear garden measuring approx 100'.
The ground floor is also complimented by a well-appointed separate reception room, and the style of these homes provide a L-shaped stair-case and this design compliments the living areas and sense of space on the ground floor. Also on the ground floor there is a utility room.
Five bedrooms on the upper floors complimented by two bathrooms (one en-suite). The master bedroom measures an impressive 14'8 by 12'3 and the rear bedroom on the first floor provides a pretty Juliet balcony overlooking the large rear garden.
