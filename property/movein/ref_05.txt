A beautifully presented and highly characterful newly refurbished and extended 4 bedroom detached family house with off-street parking, featuring wonderful original architecture and an exceptional garden.
Privately set behind double-gates (with separate pedestrian entrance), the highly engaging architecture features original timber detailing on the front and rear facades, set beneath new tiled and flat roofs.
Entering the generous entrance hall gives a wonderful sense of light and space, through to the glorious kitchen/dining room, which includes underfloor heating, a fabulous island unit and excellent storage. Bifold doors then lead through to the terrace outside.
The ground floor also benefits from a well-proportioned family/reception room and a charming study/music room. To complete this level there is a well-conceived downstairs bedroom (with direct access to the terrace) with ensuite shower room.
On the first floor vaulted ceilings enhance the sense of light and space for the master bedroom and two further bedrooms, along with the beautifully appointed family bathroom.
Outside, to the rear, the large terrace provides wonderful flat space, which then transists up timber steps to a striking Japanese-style tiered garden, offering sensational views over the house and into Brockwell Park, especially from its highest point on the covered patio, ideal for alternative evening entertaining.
