Recently modernised to impeccable specifications, this wonderful four-bedroom house occupies a highly desirable position on Half Moon Lane, a quiet residential street between the neighbourhoods of North Dulwich and Herne Hill.
The entire ground floor has been re-designed in collaboration with studio Siri Zanelli. Utilising the skills of an artisan joiner, the refurbishments include the creation of a bespoke kitchen in bamboo, birch ply and marine stainless steel, as well as a Shiatsu studio with underfloor heating. Full-height glazed doors open out through the studio onto a garden and deck with additional storage space and a wood shed.
A separate pair of glazed doors lead from the garden into an open plan dining/living area, centred around a hearth complete with contemporary wood-burning stove. Street-facing windows are set marginally below ground level and are shielded from view by a small front garden.
Newly installed acrylic FlexFloor stretches throughout the corridors and entrance hall to a spiral staircase. Upstairs double-height ceilings create a wonderful sense of space and light and a balcony extends externally from the master bedroom, looking out over the garden below. Oak floorboards run across the remainder of the first floor to the study, and two further bedrooms.
Half Moon lane is spoilt for green space with Brockwell, Belair and Dulwich parks all within walking distance. Dulwich Village offers a range of cafes, bars, restaurants, as well as the renowned Dulwich Picture Gallery; while Herne Hill’s lively Sunday market features an array of culinary options.
The property is perfectly situated for a range of local schools, including Charter, Dulwich Hamlet and Dulwich Village Infants’. While Alleyns, James Allen’s Girls’ and Dulwich College are also within walking distance.
